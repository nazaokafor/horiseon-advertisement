As an aspiring developer, refactoring a client's code to improve accessibility for its users is essential in today's world of business. 
Enhancing the functionality of already existing code is critical for maintaining user engagement and increasing user outreach, especially 
for those with disabilities. 

The main focus of this project is to showcase the features of accessibility on a marketing webpage, in order to increase its ranking on 
search results. Some of these main features include: 

1. The use of HTML5 image alt tags to provide the user with the text equivalent of an image in cases where it cannot be displayed. 
    *This feature is particularly useful for those who are visually impaired and opt out of viewing images.*

2. The use of HTML5 semantic elements on the webpage's code to give specificity to the type of content displayed on a web browser. 
   *This feature gives a clear communication from the developer to the browser about the type of content being created.* 

While working on this project, I learned that establishing the habit of using semantic elements for any code can make it easier for screen
readers to retrieve information about the organization of an HTML page. User experience on a web page is more enjoyable when specific codes 
are written for headers and link addresses. 

A small challenge I faced while working on this project was refactoring my CSS style sheet while refactoring my HTML document. I found that 
it took me a while to condense some CSS elements into smaller ones because they contained similar attributes. Despite this issue, I believe this exercise made me reflect on how I can write my HTML and CSS codes more consisely to achieve the desired result of accessibility on my webpage.
